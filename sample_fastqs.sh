# Extract some number n of random reads
#       from a given set of paired-end
#       FASTQ files. Save the sampled
#       reads to timestamped files respectively.
#
# Args:
#   IN: Input FASTQ file with forward reads.
#   PAIRED: Paired FASTQ file with reverse reads.
#   N_READS_TO_SAMPLE: Integer value corresponding
#       to the number of reads to be sampled from
#       the two input files.
#
# Output:
#   Out files' prefix depends on that of IN.
#       A suffix is added to denote the number of
#       sampled reads it contains and a timestamp
#       to differentiate distinct subsamples of the
#       same input files. Timestamps include day,
#       hour, minute and second of the subsampling.
